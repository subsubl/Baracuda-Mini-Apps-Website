## 2024-10-18 - [Nuxt Image Preload Double Download]
**Learning:** Using `preload` on `<NuxtImg>` for both light and dark mode variants (handled via CSS classes like `dark:hidden`) causes the browser to download both images, wasting bandwidth, as the preload scanner doesn't account for CSS visibility.
**Action:** Avoid `preload` on theme-dependent hero images; rely on native lazy-loading or manual preloading of the active theme's image if strictly necessary.

## 2025-05-23 - [Inline SVG Bloat]
**Learning:** Inline SVGs in Vue components, especially those exported directly from design tools without optimization, can be excessively large (e.g., 10KB+ for a single icon). This bloats the initial HTML payload and bundle size.
**Action:** Always inspect inline SVGs in critical components (like Headers/Footers). Replace complex paths with optimized standard icons (e.g., Heroicons) or use an SVG optimization tool.

## 2025-03-25 - [Vue Computed Search Optimizations]
**Learning:** Reactive computed loops that filter over arrays on every keystroke in Vue (like search) can cause unnecessary CPU overhead and garbage collection pressure due to repeatedly calling `.toLowerCase()` and allocating new strings.
**Action:** Use Nuxt's `useFetch` `transform` option to pre-compute and store these derived strings (e.g., `_searchName`) when the data is initially fetched, so the reactive filter only does simple substring checks.

## 2026-05-02 - [Map Iteration Array Allocation Optimization]
**Learning:** Using `Array.from(map.entries()).find()` for search lookups in a Vue component generates unnecessary O(N) array allocations and puts pressure on garbage collection. Direct iteration via `for...of` over `map.entries()` is significantly faster for lookups.
**Action:** When performing searches or single-pass extractions from Maps, replace `Array.from()` conversions with native `for...of` loops and use `break` for early exits to improve iteration speed and reduce memory overhead.

## 2024-07-30 - [SSR Optimization via CSS for Theme-Dependent Components]
**Learning:** Using Vue's `<client-only>` wrappers to conditionally render light/dark mode SVGs and images delays the initial paint and forces the client to download and hydrate the component before rendering. This causes Layout Shifts and delays First Contentful Paint (FCP).
**Action:** Remove `<client-only>` wrappers. Instead, render both SVG paths or image elements and use Tailwind CSS visibility classes (e.g., `hidden dark:block` and `block dark:hidden`) to let the browser handle the initial display. For SVGs sharing the same paths, use `fill-currentColor` or classes like `fill-spixi dark:fill-white` to consolidate them into a single path, reducing payload size.
